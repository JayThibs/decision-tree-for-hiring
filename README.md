# Decision Tree for hiring
Python code that decides whether someone is a good hire for you or not. 

The following image is generated in order to visualize what the decision tree does. If you pay attention to the first line of text in each box (decision), you see a statement of a certain feature being lower than a value. If the statement is true, you proceed to the box on the left and if the statement is false, you go to the box on the right. The "value" is also important because if you look at the end of a branch, it will tell you how many people were hired by having a particular set of features. For example, if you look at the first two "false", you find out that all of the 9 people who interned AND were at a top-tier school got hired at this particular company.
